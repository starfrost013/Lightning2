	- AudioDeviceHz
	- AudioChannels

	- AudioChunkSize
	- NetworkMasterServer	
	- NetworkDefaultPort
	- NetworkKeepAliveMs
* Moved MaxFPS to Graphics Section

* todo:
	- add freetype bindings
	- global usings everywhere
	- primitive root class (internal)

2022.10.27:
* Added LNetClient, LNetServer
* Refactored GlobalSettings using constants for default values and renaming properties to start with their category names.

2022.10.28:
* Client now functional.

2022.10.29:
* Implemented Renderable::Color
* Made all Primitive classes that inherit from Renderable. The PrimitiveRenderer class now just adds these classes to the Renderer so they are all subject to z-index, etc.

* Refactored the Renderer.
* PrimitiveRenderer -> PrimitiveManager and is now an asset manager.
