All of this is very early.

Lightning 2.0 feature set:
- Texture Rotation
- Multitexturing
- Controller Support (InputMethod)
- Animating fades (Renderable has colour)
- Renderer Operations (everything funneled through the Renderer), massive renderer refactoring
- FreeType2 Text Manager State Machine
- Save Global Settings automatically on exit
- GlobalSettings refactoring (start all property names with the name of their section as a start)
- Network Services (LightningNetwork.dll)
- Proper Obsoleting Practice?
- Linux for Dedicated Server
- Multiple Renderer support, RenderingBackend replacement

AnimTool:
- Editing Keyframes
- More settings?

Lightning 2.5 feature set:
- Ability to pair multiple textures and have them move with each other in an animation
- Skybox, Day/night cycle with customisable skyboxes for all regions of the day
- ParticleEffect system merged with Animation
- Don't render textures unless they move (adaptive tile refresh)
- Dynamic Cameras
- "Keyframe Everything"; integrate Animation System with everything (Animatable) (possibly 1.2)
- Attach ParticleEffects to Renderables
- Layered Rendering (z-index also)
- Video API
- Linux ????
- New Lighting Engine using Raycasting (possibly 1.3)

Lightning 2.0 feature set:
- OpenGL 3.3 renderer
- Various other fancy rendering things
- Scene Transitions
- macOS Port

At some point:
- Bytecode Engine (LightningBytecode.dll) - not sure what language yet
- Native parallax scrolling with N layers
- Multithreading
- Lightning Build Engine - build setup and everything every single build
- Vulkan Renderer?

Far future:
- Lightning 3D
- Console ports (will cost a lot of $$$$)
