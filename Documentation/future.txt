Lightning 1.2 focus:
- Controller support
- MultiTexturing
- New Lighting engine 
- Particle Keyframes or integration into 1.1 animation engine
- More SDL bypass?
- Nullable (DEFINITELY)
- .NET 7.0?
Very early thoughts, not final

There will also be a fully OpenGL-based Lightning 2.0, probably after 1.2 or 1.3
