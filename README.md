# The Lightning Game Engine

This is dead code with a bad approach and worse execution.

It is not a good idea to build huge monolithic pieces of software, and it is a worse idea to write what is supposed to be low-level graphics code in C#. Parts of the engine may be in C#, but this is not acceptable for code where performance is of extreme concern. It is an even worse idea that such software is to be designed haphazardly, leading to endless refactoring and fixing of previous fuckups. This is not how game engines are designed by sane people.

However, this was a learning experience and the code is of some use - some parts of it, like the localisation engine, were genuine successes. Therefore it has been open sourced and archived in the hope it will be of some use to others in the future.
