All of this is very early.

Lightning 2.0 feature set:
- Texture Rotation
- Multitexturing
- Controller Support (Input Method API)
- Animating fades (Renderable has colour)
- Renderer Operations (everything funneled through the Renderer), massive renderer refactoring
- FreeType2 Text Manager State Machine
- Save Global Settings automatically on exit
- GlobalSettings refactoring (start all property names with the name of their section as a start)
- Network Services
- Proper Obsoleting Practice?
- Linux for Dedicated Server only
- Multiple Renderer support, RenderingBackend replacement
- BEFORE the new lighting system, allow light blending
- Single Installer for .NET/Lightning

AnimTool:
- Editing Keyframes
- More settings?

Lightning 2.5 feature set:
- Ability to pair multiple renderables and have them move with each other in an animation
- "Keyframe Everything"; integrate Animation System with everything (Animatable class) 
- Skybox, Day/night cycle with customisable skyboxes for all regions of the day
- ParticleEffect system merged with Animation
- Don't render textures unless they move (adaptive tile refresh)
- Dynamic Cameras
- Attach ParticleEffects to Renderables
- Layered Rendering (z-index also)
- Video API
- New Lighting Engine using Raycasting (possibly 3.0)
- LightningInternal for internal renderables to fix searches 
- Maybe referents
- Scene Transitions? / FX Engine? (possibly 3.0)
- Ticks not deltatime
- How will children be able to tell if they are the original handler of an event? Better event systme for 2.5  / 3.0

Lightning 3.0 feature set:
- OpenGL 3.3 renderer
- Various other fancy rendering things
- Scene Transitions
- macOS Port
- Animated Skybox API (everything inherently animatable)
- Post-processing Engine
- Shader Manager
- New settings api for an arbitrary number of settings using a binary dictionary or JSON for high speed
- WADv4: Compressed WAD
- Full Linux Port

At some point:
- Bytecode Engine (LightningBytecode.dll) - not sure what language yet
- Native parallax scrolling with N layers
- Multithreading
- Actual physics engine
- Dynamic transitions
- Lightning Build Environment - build setup and everything every single build
- Vulkan Renderer?
- Asset Manager
- Inheritable Properties

Far future:
- Lightning 3D
- Console ports (will cost a lot of $$$$)
- IDE
