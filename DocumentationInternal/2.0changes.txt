Lightning 2.0
Changes

Everything that matters to the api has to go here

2022.10.26:
* Began working on LightningNetwork
* Made MinimumCpuCapabilities and MinimumOperatingSystem case-insensitive [1.1 Backport]
* Added new GlobalSettings (network settings to be moved to new LightningServer.ini):
	- AudioDeviceHz
	- AudioChannels
	- AudioFormat
	- AudioChunkSize
	- NetworkMasterServer	
	- NetworkDefaultPort
	- NetworkKeepAliveMs
* Moved MaxFPS to Graphics Section

2022.10.27:
* Added LNetClient, LNetServer

2022.10.28:
* Client now functional.

2022.10.29:
* Implemented Renderable::Color
* Made all Primitive classes that inherit from Renderable. The PrimitiveRenderer class now just adds these classes to the Renderer so they are all subject to z-index, etc.

2022.10.30:
* Refactored the Renderer.
* PrimitiveRenderer -> PrimitiveManager and is now an asset manager.

2022.11.02:
* Bugfixes in primitives.

2022.11.04:
* Updated SDL2_gfx for some minor optimisation in C=+ (it will now automatically draw AA Lines when thickness is 1)
* Started working on allowing all primitives to have borders. 

2022.11.04:
* Added border support to all primitives (except basictext).
* Removed ability to initialise lightning without the Scene Manager.
* Fixed Scene::Shutdown.

2022.11.05:
* PrimitiveManager::Draw**** -> PrimitiveManager::Add****

2022.11.06:
* LightningGL properly uses nullable.
* Make PrimitiveManager return the primitive type, add border parameters to all Primitives.

* Fix bug with default window locations.
* Console Core

2022.11.07:
* Renderer is now an immutable singleton
* Renderer removed as a parameter to all methods
* Merged SceneManager and Lightning
* Renderer now stores all Renderables and has global methods (AddRenderable, RemoveRenderable, GetRenderableWithName, ContainsRenderable) for searching them
* 1.2 -> 2.0 due to total incompatibility
* Added new GlobalSettings
	- DebugKey
	- DebugDisabled
	- DebugLineDistance
* Added new Events
	- OnCreate (default implementation - Renderable::Create)
	- OnDestroy (default implementation - Renderable::Destroy)
* GlobalSettings::Renderer -> GlobalSettings::RenderingBaclend
* Implement Renderable::CanReceiveEventsWhileUnfocused for focus-only events
* ForegroundColor now used for cursors, CursorColor is dead

2022.11.12:
* Renderer now applies camera transformations

* Simplified rendering code
* Began working on multiple renderer capabilities
* Fix positional sound

2022.11.13:

* fix sdkbuild option logging, add timer for builds
* fix bug in containsrenderablebyname, getrenderablebyname, etc

2022.11.29:
